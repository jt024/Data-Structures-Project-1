Project 1 – Linked List Stack

Write a program that implements a stack using a linked list.  Your GUI should allow 
the user to push integers on the stack, or pop integers off the stack.  Your program should 
not crash if the user pops an empty stack. Do not use Java’s built in stack or linked list.
